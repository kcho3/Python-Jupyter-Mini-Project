#Final Python Project

The selectedcountries.csv file comes from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases and is the number of confirmed COVID cases in countries all over the world. For this project, specifically, I decided to choose 3 countries over a time period of 100 days from the starting date. The 3 countries are Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria.
